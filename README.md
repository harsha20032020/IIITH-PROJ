# COVID TRACING PROJECT

This is a project which is a scaled down version of contact tracing and application of graphs in real life.This project has been made entirely in C and can basically perform certain queries regarding conditions of people when given a list of infected people and also can give the most safest path that should be taken in order to minimize chances of contracting the Virus.

## Installation

Just gitclone/Download the project repo and run using gcc

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheAthleticCoder/IIITH-PROJ
gcc main.c
./a.out
```
## Index

### 1.extra.c and extra.h
Contain generic functions for implementations of linked lists ,stacks and queues which are used in subsequently.
### 2.graph.c and graph.h
Contains functions for implementations of graphs and Dijkstra's and safety values concept which is crucial for solving part 2 of the question.
### 3.personll.c and personll.h
Contains functions and structures for storing and querying data regarding people and stations.

## Usage

```
It Has somewhat of an interactive UI and hence the user needs to enter values when queried.
```
